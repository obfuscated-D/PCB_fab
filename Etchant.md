## Etchant Solution (Not Ferric Chloride)
### **Taken From this instructable** https://www.instructables.com/Stop-using-Ferric-Chloride-etchant!--A-better-etc/

### **Materials**
- 250ml 15% muriatic acid (look up the concentration of your acid, adjust accordingly)
- 250ml 3% Hydrogen Peroxide
### ** WARNING: NEVER ADD WATER (YOUR PEROXIDE) INTO ACID- ALWAYS ADD ACID INTO WATER, YOU CAN CREATE AN OUT OF CONTROL EXOTHERMIC REACTION
### **Proceedure** 
- Start with 250ml of Hydrogen Peroxide in a non-metallic container (Glass or HDPE)
- Slowly add Muriatic acid. Watch out for heat generation

- Once mixed, etch a board with the solution, or dissolve a small amount of copper. Your etchant is now ready to use
### **Maintenance**
- Occassionally the solution will need topped off with a small amount of acid, and oxygen (just air) bubbled through it. Do this if etching gets slow
- Store in a Non-Metallic, oxidising acid resistant container (HDPE, or glass)
