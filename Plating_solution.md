# Electrolytic Plating Solution - 7 Gallons

## Materials:

* 7 Gallons - Distilled Water
* 9.33 lbs - Copper Sulfate (Zep Root Killer)
* 7oz - Copper Brightener A (Caswellplating.com) 
* 18.67oz - Copper Brightener B (Caswellplating.com)
* 4 lbs - Borax (20 Mule Team)
* 93.3oz (9 1/3 cups) - ~37% Sulfuric Acid ( Battery Acid from auto parts store)

# Ratios:
- 1 Gallon Distilled Water
- 1.33 lbs Copper Sulfate
- 1 oz Copper Brightener A
- 2.67 oz Copper Brightener B
- 9.12 oz  Borax
- 13.33 oz 37% Sulfuric Acid

### Note: The Brightener isn't strictly necessary, it acts as a leveler and provides a "bright" copper finish. If you don't have the brightener, you can use Polyethylene Glycol as a substitute leveler (it works quite well). A good source is Miralax unflavored powder, it is 100% pure PEG.

## PEG solution:
- 18g Polyethylene Glycol
- 100ml Distilled water

    - Dissolve PEG in water. 
    - Add 5ml/liter of the mix to the plating solution
