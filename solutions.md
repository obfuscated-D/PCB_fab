## LPKF PCB Cleaner 110 (1 Gallon Recipe)

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Concentration | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 20 Mule Team Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate) | 178 grams | ~4.7% | Converts to Sodium Metaborate (alkaline cleaner, pH buffer) |
| Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH, pure lye flakes or pellets) | 38 grams | ~1% | Converts Borax into Sodium Metaborate; increases alkalinity |
| Triton X-100 (nonionic surfactant) | 38 grams | ~1% | Enhanced wetting and cleaning effectiveness |
| Distilled (DI) Water | ~3.53 liters | Balance (~93.3%) | Solvent and carrier |

### Step-by-Step Preparation Instructions

**Safety First:** Always wear protective gloves, safety goggles, and ensure proper ventilation.

#### Procedure

1. **Initial Water**
   - Begin by adding approximately 3 liters of distilled water into a clean, plastic or glass container.

2. **Sodium Hydroxide Addition**
   - Slowly add 38 grams of Sodium Hydroxide flakes or pellets.
   - Stir gently until completely dissolved.

3. **Sodium Tetraborate (20 Mule Team Borax) Addition**
   - Add 178 grams of Borax slowly to the mixture.
   - Stir continuously until fully dissolved. This converts to Sodium Metaborate.

4. **Surfactant (Triton X-100) Addition**
   - Add 38 grams of Triton X-100.
   - Stir gently to mix uniformly. Slight foaming is normal.

5. **Final Dilution**
   - Add distilled water to reach a total volume of exactly 1 gallon (3.785 liters).
   - Stir gently to mix thoroughly.

**Storage:** Store sealed at room temperature. The solution remains effective for several months.

## Activator 310 Formulation (1 Gallon Batch)

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Distilled/DI Water | ~3.55 liters (~94%) | Solvent & carrier |
| Ketjenblack EC-300J | 151 grams (~4%) | Conductive filler |
| Triton X-100 (or similar) | 19–38 grams (~1%) | Surfactant for stable dispersion |
| Potassium Carbonate | 38–57 grams (~1–2%) | pH Stabilizer (~pH 9–11) |

### Step-by-Step Preparation Instructions

**Safety First:** Wear protective gloves, goggles, and ensure proper ventilation.

#### Procedure

1. **Initial Water**
   - Begin with approximately 3.4 liters of distilled water in a clean plastic or glass container.

2. **Carbon Addition**
   - Slowly add 151 grams of Ketjenblack EC-300J while gently stirring to ensure proper dispersion.

3. **Surfactant Addition**
   - Gradually add 19–38 grams of Triton X-100 (or similar surfactant), continuing to stir.

4. **pH Adjustment**
   - Add 38–57 grams of Potassium Carbonate slowly to adjust the pH to approximately 9–11.
   - Stir gently and monitor pH levels as needed.

5. **Final Mixing & Dispersion**
   - Stir gently and optionally use sonication to maximize dispersion and ensure uniformity.

6. **Final Dilution**
   - Top off with remaining distilled water to reach exactly 1 gallon (3.785 liters).
   - Mix thoroughly to ensure uniform consistency.

**Storage:** Store in a sealed container at room temperature, shaking gently before each use to re-disperse any settled particles.
