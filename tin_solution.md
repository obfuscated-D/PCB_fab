For a tin electroplating solution using 99% pure tin, H₂O₂, and H₂SO₄:

**Recipe:**
- 10g of tin metal (powder or small pieces works best)
- 30ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (300ml of 3% solution)
- 50ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (98%) (~140ml of 37%)
- 500ml of distilled water (reduce to 400ml if using 37% sulfuric acid, reduce another ~250ml if using 3% hydrogen peroxide)

**Procedure:**
1. Add the sulfuric acid slowly to the distilled water in a heat-resistant glass container
2. Let cool to room temperature
3. Add tin metal
4. Slowly add hydrogen peroxide while stirring (reaction produces heat)
5. Stir until tin is dissolved
6. Add remaining water to reach desired concentration

**Safety precautions:**
- Always wear proper eye protection, acid-resistant gloves, and work in well-ventilated area
- Add acid to water, never reverse
- The reaction is exothermic - use cooling if needed
