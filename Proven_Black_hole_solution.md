## Author: Thomas Gatliff

### Ingredients

1. **Cabot VULCAN XC72 Carbon Black**
   - 2-5g per liter (Start with 2g and eyeball it based on adhesion)

2. **Surfactant** – Helps dispersion and wetting of vias
   - 1-2 mL of Triton X-100 (or 0.5-1g of SDS)

3. **Binder** – Helps adhesion of carbon black to the PCB
   - 1-2g of Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)

4. **Dispersing Agent** – Prevents carbon black from clumping
   - 0.5-1g of sodium polyacrylate (can also use ammonium polyphosphate)

5. **pH Adjuster** – Keeps solution stable and promotes adhesion
   - Ammonia (pH 9-10 ish) – Adjust if you see settling

6. **Deionized Water** – Carrier for the suspension
   - 1 liter total volume

### Preparation Steps

#### Step 1: Carbon Black
1. Weigh 2-5g of Cabot VULCAN XC72.
2. Mix it in 500mL of deionized water.
3. Put in liquid grinder mixer for at least 24 hours to ensure fine dispersion.
4. Add 0.5-1g dispersing agent while mixing to stabilize the dispersion.

#### Step 2: Add Surfactant
1. Add 1-2mL Triton X-100 (or 0.5-1g SDS).
2. Mix for 10 minutes to ensure proper wetting.

#### Step 3: Binder
1. Dissolve 1-2g of PVA in warm water.
2. Add it slowly while mixing to avoid clumping.

#### Step 4: pH Adjustment
1. Measure the pH of the solution.
2. If needed, add ammonia dropwise until pH reaches 9-10.

#### Step 5: Final Dilution
1. Add deionized water to bring the total volume to 1 liter.
2. Mix for 15 minutes to ensure uniform dispersion and pH balance if any settling.
